The following are personas copied from Resultant's PE Data Maturity Whitepaper

Program Maturity (Maturity increases from foundational to innovative):

Foundational:

Ad Hoc / Firefighing: DESCRIPTION: No system alignment. Metrics live in spreadsheets. Business processes vary across units.

VALUE AND RISKS: Low value.  Decisions are reactive and sometimes wrong.  No audit trail or trust in KPIs. HOW TO ADVANCE: Conduct a Strategic Data Roadmap. Focus on process standardization and define which KPIs matter and how to measure them. –GENAI READINESS: Consider GenAI for summarizing qualitative data (e.g., customer feedback, frontline insights) to inform initial hypotheses

 

Foundational-Evolving:

Standardized/ Foundational: DESCRIPTION: Defined KPIs and basic reporting from source systems. Data still manually pulled and maintained. VALUE AND RISKS: Reliable descriptive reporting. Some time savings. But still limited to hindsight. HOW TO ADVANCE: Start sprint-based implementations to show proof of value.  Standardize metric definitions across BUs. GENAI READINESS: Pilot GenAI for tasks like auto-generating performance summaries or variance analyses in management reports

 

Evolving:

Integrated/ Insight-driven: DESCRIPTION: Systems integrated, reporting automated. Data used in weekly decision-making. VALUE AND RISKS: Decisions are faster, better, and consistent. Functional leaders trust insights. HOW TO ADVANCE: Implement a scalable data platform (preferably SaaS unless regulatory concerns exist). – Focus on business use cases. GENAI READINESS: Introduce GenAI for dynamic Q&A against dashboards and to generate meeting prep materials or executive summaries.

 

Evolving/ Innovative:

Predictive/ Optimized:DESCRIPTION: Data science applied to forecasting, pricing, inventory, churn. Aligned with business priorities. VALUE AND RISKS: Competitive edge. Smart growth decisions. Business units proactively respond to signals. HOW TO ADVANCE: Embed analytics in operations. Introduce self-service BI. Validate data governance framework. GENAI READINSS: Use GenAI to simulate strategic decisions (e.g., pricing, resource planning), auto-draft insights, and generate scenario playbooks

 

Innovative:

Strategic/ Value Multiplier: DESCRIPTION; Data infrastructure is a differentiator. Supports M&A, GTM agility, and rapid scaling. VALUE AND RISKS: Strategic buyer or IPO-ready. High valuation multiple justified. HOW TO ADVANCE:  Adopt Managed Services to reduce run-rate cost and ensure platform continuity. Keep governance tight and forward-looking. GENAI READINESS:  Establish a DataOps + GenAI operating model. GenAI co-pilots can assist with operational decisions, regulatory narrative generation, and ongoing insight delivery across functions
