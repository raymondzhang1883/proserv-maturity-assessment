## Key Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture:
- Modular scoring engine with separate components for each dimension
- Persona determination based on total score thresholds
- Lead scoring overlay adds qualification layer beyond maturity assessment
- Recommendation engine combines base persona recommendations with contextual modifiers

### Content Strategy:
- Questions focus on current-state assessment rather than aspirational goals
- Scoring rewards both breadth (coverage) and depth (automation/sophistication)
- Personas represent realistic maturity progression with clear advancement paths
- Recommendations provide concrete next steps rather than general advice

### Business Logic:
- Assessment designed for professional services industry (utilization, margins, client satisfaction)
- Scoring weights emphasize coverage and automation as primary maturity indicators
- Lead scoring identifies high-intent prospects with decision-making authority
- CTA framework matches urgency and stakeholder level to appropriate engagement type

This framework can be adapted to other industries by:
1. Replacing industry-specific KPIs with relevant performance metrics
2. Adjusting persona descriptions to match industry challenges
3. Modifying recommendations to address sector-specific pain points
4. Updating lead scoring modifiers for industry buying patterns
5. Customizing CTAs for industry-appropriate engagement types
